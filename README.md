## 💌 What Is This?

This is the **cutest Valentine's Day proposal code** on the internet — a fully interactive, **HTML5 CSS3 JS project** wrapped in the dreamy **Coquette Aesthetic** that's taking over TikTok in 2026.

Send it to your crush, your partner, or your pookie — and watch them try (and fail) to say no. 😏

### ✨ Why it goes viral:

> The "No" button **never works**. Every time they click it, the text changes to something more desperate & adorable — and the "Yes" button **grows bigger and bigger** until it's impossible to ignore. It's giving unhinged romance and the internet *lives* for it.

Think: **Gen Z Scrapbook Style** love letter meets chaotic boyfriend energy. It's the **TikTok Viral Website Idea** you didn't know you needed.
